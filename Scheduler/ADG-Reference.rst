ADG Syntax Reference
================================

The Architecture Description Graph describes the underlying CGRA hardware capabilities. It is a directive graph between different hardware nodes.

The ADG is generated by both the chipyard generator and as a result of the Design Space Explorer (DSE). The ADG also serves as an input into both the DSE and Chipyard generator, to create better hardware designs and simulate capabilites. The scheduler schedules DFG graphs onto the ADG.

## ADG Node Types

The ADG is composed of different hardware modules, each containing their own attributes. These hardware modules are then connected to form the whole ADG. The different hardware modules are as follows:

1. Spatial Nodes
 * Processing Elements
 * Switches
2. Sync Nodes
 * Input Vector Port
 * Output Vector Port
3. Data Nodes
 * Direct Memory Access
 * Scratchpad
 * Register
 * Generate
 * Recurrance

In this section, we will go through each category and describe both their functionality and ADG attributes.

### Spatial Nodes

Spatial Nodes envelop the actual computation and datapath of the CGRA. Thus, these nodes make up a majority of the ADG resources. 

#### Processing Elements

Processing Elements operate as the functional units within the CGRA. Their main purpose is to perform computation. As such, their attributes are as follows:
