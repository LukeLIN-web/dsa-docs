Programming Interfaces
======================

This section introduces programming interfaces of our DSAs. We provide both
high-level language and embedded assembly code, both in C, programming.
Both programming interfaces will be introduced through simple examples.

Because it requires a lengthy process to study the compiler flags and resolve
the header file dependencies, we provide software development kits (SDK) for a
better developer experience.
